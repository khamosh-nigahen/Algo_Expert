/**
 * Two things to consider before taking a recursive approach
 * 
 * 1. If you find yourself defining your problem into smaller versions of the same problem, 
 *    it's a pretty good indication that recursion could be useful here.
 * 
 * 2. The first question we have to ask ourselves is what is the base case. 
 *    The base case is when we stop recursing.
 *    If we don't have a base case, then our recursion will spiral out of control and we will run out of memory
